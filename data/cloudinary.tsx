      <p>Not like I am particularly good at that, but I enjoy seeing those moments later. That brings me to CDN's
        because those photos should be stored and delivered.</p>
      <p>After some googling, I choose Cloudinary because it has some nice features and a decent free plan - 25000
        transformations or 25 GB storage or 25 GB bandwidth monthly.</p>

          <p>I will receive more free services for every registered user. So if you like my photos, go on, click on

      <p>Cloudinary has a react library, but I did not find any image gallery. So here is how I did it.</p>
      <p>After uploading images to Cloudinary servers, I tag them. After that, I fetch the list of photos by this URL: </p>
      <Code language={"typescript"}>{`\`https://res.cloudinary.com/\${your_username}/image/list/\${tag}.json\``}</Code>
      <p>response type:</p>
      <Code language={"typescript"}>{code}</Code>
      <p>Here is source code <a target='_blank'
                                href="https://github.com/Lurk/barhamon/blob/master/components/cloudinary.tsx">cloudinary.tsx</a>  how
        I use it with<br/> <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/xiaolin/react-image-gallery">React Carousel Image Gallery</a>
      </p>
      <p>If you look at lines 64 and 65, you will notice the <b>srcSet</b> and <b>sizes</b> field. You may ask how I calculate those params?<br/>I did not :)</p>
      <p>I used the excellent <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/ausi/respimage">RespImageLint</a> tool by
        Martin Ausw√∂ger.</p>
