There are thousands of switchbacks in every shape and form. Tight, wide, left, right, up, down, steep, 
gentle, wet mud, dry mud, big rocks, small stones, gravel, sand, good asphalt, bad asphalt, snow, and 
any combination of all of the above. Sometimes trail disappears. Sometimes, it crosses a river, and 
sometimes it goes through a dead village. One section was on the dried creek bed, with big stones and a 
steep incline. I was dying on that hill, like, for real. My lungs were exploding. My heart was jumping 
out of my chest. I spent all my energy fighting that hill. But we managed to conquer it despite the lack 
of experience. It was cold when we reached the first high mountain covered with snow. We turned around a 
lot cos our way was blocked by deep snow. It felt like we were stuck there forever.At some point, we were 
riding through one of those dead villages, and I thought we needed to break into one of the houses, 
start burning furniture, hunt stray dogs, and wait for spring. A couple of days later, we drove through 
the snowy summit again. I don't know if that was gained experience or the sun shining, but it felt much 
less dramatic and easier to drive. Whenever I thought I had seen everything, something new and beautiful 
came around the corner. One day we were climbing up through the canyon and ended up on a vast rocky 
plane with patches of cultivated soil here and there. It was unbelievably beautiful under the morning 
sun. And once we had long and tiresome descent from the mountain on a dirt road destroyed by the stream, 
which ended up with a wide and empty highway. It felt like a treat after hard work. At the end of the 
first half of our route was a 3000m summit. We decided that we had enough snow already and skipped it.`,

      And, of course, we had our bit of adventures. Once the road ended up in a newly constructed water 
      reservoir. The other time we ran into logs lying across our way. So yeah, there were a few 
      turnarounds and searches for an alternative route.`,

      the distance to the city of Tashkent. In Tashkent, we drove past the hotel that looked abandoned twice 
      before we decided to try the doors. For the 15 euros, we got two rooms with a view, breakfast, and a 
      shower. I have never enjoyed a warm shower that much in my life. On all other days, we started to look for 
      the camping spot around 5 pm. Our requirements were simple: fresh water, no snow, and as far from 
      civilization as possible. We could always find a place within 50km of our position. Sometimes it was 
      relatively easy to reach, and sometimes, it was not easy at all. I vividly remember how I was tumbling down 
      the hill and praying that my motorcycle does not follow me. Thankfully it did not. That was 100 meters from 
      only one flat patch of the land, big enough to put a tent there. But the spot was worth it.`,

      spot of those bikes and that we should not ride deep sand or any other terrain that involves heavy clutch 
      usage. If we do and run out of the clutch, it will be our problem. The older bike ran out of the clutch on a 
      second day. I am sure it was not our fault, but that was our problem. The closest city where that clutch 
      could be replaced was 60 km away. Those were the longest 60 km in my life, and I even was not riding a faulty 
      bike. When we reached Isparta city, the clutch was replaced in an hour and 100 euros. On the same day, but later, 
      I lost my license plate. I rode to the point where it was seen last time with no luck. It had already tried to 
      escape on the first day, and we tied it with straps, but apparently, it was not enough. I asked the rental what
