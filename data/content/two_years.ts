I did not notice anything unreasonable. Maybe it is my thing. Germany is the fifth country where I live, and perhaps I developed subconscious routines to avoid all of it. Maybe. But yeah, I do not have much to complain about. Oh no! You know, I have a thing to complain about. In Munich, we have self-service bike stations, you know, essential tools, air pumps, and so on. They are scattered across the whole city. And you know what? On most of them, the air pump is broken. As Germans would say - this is unacceptable.",

But it is so convenient to have 20 minutes commute time and one hour to the mountains that moving is still on the back burner.",

Apart from promotion, there was a 3-year LTC, which is basically our (employee/employer) mutual agreement that we want to work together for at least three years more. I needed some time to think about it before I signed. It felt like I am getting too comfortable in my comfort zone, and that commitment will force me to stay in it for three years more.
