As you can see in my previous posts, I like photography.

Not like I am particularly good at that, but I enjoy seeing those moments later. That brings me to CDN's because those photos should be stored and delivered.

After some googling, I choose Cloudinary because it has some nice features and a decent free plan - 25000 transformations or 25 GB storage or 25 GB bandwidth monthly.

I will receive more free services for every registered user. So if you like my photos, go on, click on that link, and register. [That link](https://cloudinary.com/invites/lpov9zyyucivvxsnalc5/hqd3swadmblfw3ivxjmv)

Cloudinary has a react library, but I did not find any image gallery. So here is how I did it.

After uploading images to Cloudinary servers, I tag them. After that, I fetch the list of photos by this URL:

```typescript
`https://res.cloudinary.com/${your_username}/image/list/${tag}.json`
```

response type:

```typescript
interface CloudinaryTagResponse {
  resources: Array<{
    "public_id": string,
    "version": number,
    "format": string,
    "width": number,
    "height": number,
    "type": string,
    "created_at": string,
  }>,
  "updated_at": string,
}
```

Here is source code [cloudinary.tsx](https://github.com/Lurk/barhamon/blob/master/components/cloudinary.tsx) how I use it with [React Carousel Image Gallery](https://github.com/xiaolin/react-image-gallery)

If you look at lines 64 and 65, you will notice the **srcSet** and **sizes** field. You may ask how I calculate those params? I did not :)

I used the excellent [RespImageLint](https://github.com/ausi/respimage) tool created by Martin Ausw√∂ger.
