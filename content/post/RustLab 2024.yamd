It was a long time ago, and I couldnâ€™t write anything longer than would fit in a toot. It is weird because that was my
first conference, and it felt awesome to be one of two hundred geeks who truly care about their craft. I enjoyed the
entire experience.

The workshop part was awesome (I ran out of positive adjectives). In the first session, I developed my shell, which can
execute commands, change the current directory, and perform basic logic and grouping. In the second session, I created
a TUI chat client using RatatUI. I had a great time working on them. The workshops were the best part of the
conference, and I really look forward to the next one.

!! Should I make shell and chat TUI public?
! github
I donâ€™t think so. Most importantly, I donâ€™t intend to support or improve them, at least not for now.

Then, there were two days of cool presentations. I havenâ€™t taken any notes, and looking back, I see that they would
help me write this post. On the other hand, I wouldnâ€™t have enjoyed the presentations as much if I had been distracted
by note-taking. So yeah, no regrets.

In the opening presentation, [Tim Clicks](https://mastodon.nz/@timClicks) talked about ways to improve software
quality. One of the techniques he mentioned was fuzing. At home I scrolled through the photo roll and found the library
name he was using.

I took some technical pictures to remember the talks, which proved helpful. However, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good idea to
share those pictures. I havenâ€™t asked the people in those images for permission to share them, and Iâ€™m too lazy
to gather their permissions.

I maintain a markdown flavor/parser. This blog uses it, and I know one more person who at least tried to use it. Hi
Augustin ðŸ––. I wouldnâ€™t say that itâ€™s a battle-tested piece of software, but itâ€™s pretty solid and has never panicked
on me. It has 100% code coverage and is written in Rust (by the way, TM). I am telling you all that not to brag about
how cool it is (maybe a little) but to illustrate my confidence in it. I was very confident that YAMD had no obvious
bugs. And you know what? Cargo-fuzz library found three bugs in less than a second. Iâ€™m very impressed and highly
recommend incorporating fuzing into your workflow.

!! cargo-fuzz
! rust
Has all the bells and whistles you can imagine. Check out the
[Rust Fuzz Book](https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/cargo-fuzz.html) for more details. It is totally worth it.

One of the most unexpected and positive outcomes for me was the one I got from Cooking Parsers with Winnit by
[Santiago Fraire Willemoes](https://woile.dev/). His story about creating a new language to describe cooking recipes
inspired me to keep working on YAMD. Itâ€™s not that I lacked inspiration to do so, but at times it felt pointless. There
are plenty of markdown parsers and flavors available. I could use one of them, as I always have, and it would be
perfectly fine. Seeing in person that Iâ€™m not the only one reinventing the wheel adds meaning to the whole enterprise.
I donâ€™t know how that works.

recipes! â€¨

Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t have the time and energy to explore the city, but the venue was a 20-minute walk from my hotel.
I experienced enough of Florence to be certain that I will return someday. And, as a note to myself, next time I should
take at least one day before and after conference. It was tough with traveling.
