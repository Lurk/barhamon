In one of the first posts, I promised to post the music here. This time has come.

I have a Telegram channel where I have been posting music for quite some time for my friends. The first step is to 
move all the entries I already posted there. It is pretty simple to download the channel archive from telegram. And, 
because I can, I wrote some tools on Rust to convert data to a format my blog will understand, upload images, and so 
on.

If you are interested in code, check those GitHub repos: 
[telegram-post-converter](https://github.com/Lurk/telegram-post-converter) and 
[Cloudinary SDK](https://github.com/Lurk/cloudinary_rs). Maybe I will make an effort to make something resembling a 
crate from the Cloudinary SDK repo.

The second step is translating old descriptions into English, checking for broken links, and so on. This is a work in 
progress. You can already check the stuff here: [music](/tag/music). I wouldnâ€™t say I like how it looks, so expect 
some change in design.

I also think about implementing [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) as part of a migration to Rust. But it took 
me two years to start migrating my music posts here, so no promises.
