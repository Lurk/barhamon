I was so focused on the [upcoming adventure](https://barhamon.com/post/EDT%20France%20preparations.html) that I just
realized - summer is over. My last roll was in June, and since then, I have been very busy with:

- [Bicycle trips](#Bicycle%20trips.)
- [Music](#Music.)
- [Work](#Work.)
- [Mushroom hunting](#Mushroom%20hunting.)
- [Pet Projects](#Pet%20projects.)

## Bicycle trips.

To prepare for this year's adventure, I rode my bicycle as often and as far as possible. Those riding days produced
most of today's roll.

## Mushroom hunting.

Typically, mushroom hunting is an autumn activity. But this summer was so wet that we managed to hunt enough mushrooms
in the middle of it.

## Music.

Apart from finalising one more single, which will be released in October, I worked hard on my next LP. I would say it
is 80% ready. I hope to finish it this year, but I make no promises.

## Pet projects.

### BAR.

Yeah, one of my friends decided to try [BAR](https://github.com/Lurk/bar) and found a few bugs and missing features.
You can thank Stas for better error messages and the ability to control social links in the
[Hamon theme](https://github.com/Lurk/Hamon) with a config file.

I always struggled with alt texts for pictures, especially in galleries. Now, if enabled,
[BAR](https://github.com/Lurk/bar) will download a tiny image to the text
[MoonDream1 model](https://huggingface.co/vikhyatk/moondream1)
and generate those alt texts. It will use Metal or CPU to run the model. Theoretically, it will also work on CUDA, but
I do not have a device to test it.

### Serve

There are quite a few updates in [Serve](https://github.com/Lurk/serve).

- http->https redirect. Turned out you can't update certificates with certbot without it. Actually, you can, but it
will require [more work](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555.html).
- Log to a file with log rotation.
- The number of arguments [Serve](https://github.com/Lurk/serve) received grew over time, and editing them became
annoying. To combat that, it now supports a toml config file.

## Work.

Starting from September, I am leading a new project in [Check24](https://check24.de/). This is quite a significant
change from what I did before, and I am pretty excited about that since I havenâ€™t started a new project in a while. As
with all new projects, this one is full of challenges, which I hope to overcome without burning myself or anybody else
out.
