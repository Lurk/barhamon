Now with a memory leak üéâ

Since my first [mention](/post/clink) of it, I've made a lot of changes. If you interested in changelog you can look at the [releases](https://github.com/Lurk/clink/releases) page.

But most important thing that I noticed is a memory leak. To be completely honest, I am not sure if there is a memory leak, but it looks there is. So yeah, I noticed that after couple of weeks clink process consumes more than 600mb of RAM. I found it wrong because this is a small app, and my expectation is that it should be less than a megabyte.

I still did not find the time to do a proper analysis what is going on. So far, I have a couple of theories :

- I am so ‚Äútalented‚Äù that even languages with ‚Äúmemory safe‚Äú selling point are leaking in my hands. 
- There is something that I don't know about how memory allocation works on Mac OS
- I am using the ,[clipboard@0.5.0](https://crates.io/crates/clipboard/0.5.0), crate, and the leak is there.

I read a couple of blog post about how to approach tasks like that, and it feels like takes couple of daysüòî

And one more thing‚Ñ¢ - when I packed my stuff, I noticed that I am running low on T-shirts. And guess what? Now I have the clink T-Shirt. At first, I did not liked it. I mean printing quality was not that impressive, but the longer I have it, more I like it. Maybe, when I will have time or inspiration there will be 1.1 version of it. Right now I do not know why you will want one, but if you do - drop me a message.
