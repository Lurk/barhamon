I still do not have a motorcycle or a room to work on it. But when I will, I’ll be ready.

Despite the book's name, you’ll not be ready to build your motorcycle—at least, I am not. The author is honest about
this from the beginning, saying that you will need specific manuals for specific parts of your build. But that’s a
great book to get inspired and start building.

I liked it all. It feels like the author put much love and care into it. 

If you are thinking about a present for a person who is into motorcycles, or you are into motorcycles yourself, that
book will be a perfect gift.
