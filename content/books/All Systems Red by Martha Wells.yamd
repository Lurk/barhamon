I havenâ€™t read a story like The Stainless Steel Rat in a long time. The setting is in a far future where you'll find
robots, space travel, aliens, a relatable main character, and more. I liked it.

The size of the book is perfect for reading on a trip. I will definitely get the next chapter for my next one.
