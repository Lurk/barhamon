The best competency porn out there. 

What I like about Andy Weirâ€™s works is that his main characters are ordinary people who are just good at their jobs. 
You can argue that astronauts are not ordinary people. And you are right. I guess. But what I meant is that they don't 
have any superpowers. Like you know, there is a problem, and they suck at solving it at the beginning. Then, they 
figure it out using their skills and a bit of luck. And when they see that problem again - they do not suck anymore. 

I want more of that everywhere. 

Being good at your job is sexy.
